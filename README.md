Based on Django Tutorial

Start here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/


#Notes
This project is licensed under BSD license because Django is also. Most of this code is written following the tutorial link above.

#Other Notes
1) The tutorial puts a mysite folder inside another root folder called mysite. The root folder of this project is instead basic-poll.
2) More notes to come later...
